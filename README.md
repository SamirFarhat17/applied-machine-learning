# Applied Machine Learning with Python

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to applied machine learning using core Python libraries, including NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to implement practical machine learning models and conduct data analysis and visualization.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning with pandas
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Statistical analysis and feature engineering
- Building and evaluating machine learning models

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
